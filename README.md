## Main Info
Contains my personal configuration of Emacs. If you want to use it, please make sure to run on a Linux Environment.

## Use
Execute deploy.sh and the script does it magic. Just make sure to exclude/backup your previous .emacs file before executing it.

## Credits
All of .emacs.rc code was originally written in this awesome [repo](https://github.com/rexim/dotfiles) made by user [rexim](https://github.com/rexim).
